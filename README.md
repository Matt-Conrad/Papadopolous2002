# Implementation of CAD Paper by Papadopolous (2002)

This project is an implementation of the paper "An automatic microcalcification detection system based on a hybrid neural network classifier" by Papadopolous (2002). The paper can be found here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365702000131. 

This code currently only implements sections up to and including 2.3, so the following parts of the algorithm are implemented: 
-preprocessing and segmentation module
-region of interest specification

While I will not include the paper, for each command in the script I've added the relevant sentences in the comments above each command. 

### Python Modules required

- numpy (1.16.4)
- matplotlib.pyplot (3.1.0)
- scipy (1.3.0)
- opencv (3.4.2)
